# Payphone AI Naming Research
**Research Date:** January 27, 2026

---

## Summary

This research explores two naming directions for the AI payphone project:

1. **Retrophone-style compound names** - Creative combinations of nostalgic/retro words with telephony terms, optimized for branding and domain availability
2. **Fictional phone companies from media** - Comprehensive catalog of memorable fictional telephone companies and services from movies, TV, video games, anime, and comics that could inspire project names

### Key Findings

**Compound Names:** 27+ brandable options identified with likely domain availability across .com/.io/.ai extensions. Top contenders include RetroBell, NeonDial, CopperLine, and ModemTone - all evoking 1990s telephone nostalgia without obvious brand conflicts.

**Fictional References:** 30+ fictional telecom companies and services documented across all media types. Notable inspirations include "The Phone Company" (SNL's iconic monopoly satire), Network 23 (Max Headroom), WorldSat Communications (Cyberpunk 2077), and Hero Hotline (DC Comics' 1-800-555-HERO service).

**Pop Culture Moments:** Iconic phone booth scenes from Bill & Ted ("Circuits of Time"), The Matrix (hardline exits), and famous phone numbers like 555-2368 (Ghostbusters) and KL5-3226 (Mr. Plow) provide additional naming inspiration.

| **NeonDial** | Neon-lit 90s arcades | Looks clear; domains likely open |
| **CopperLine** | Copper phone line heritage | Appears unused; domains likely open |

More experimental names combining specific 1990s cultural elements with telephony:

**Technology + Phone Terms:**
- Dial-Up Grunge Line
- Y2K Busy Signal Co.
- AOL Arcade Operator
- CD-ROM Collect Call Co.
- Pager Arcade Connect

**Pop Culture + Telephony:**
